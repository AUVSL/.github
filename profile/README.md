# About AUVSL

AUVSL stands for the Autonomous and Unmanned Vehicle Systems Laboratory.
AUVSL develops solutions for real world government and industry problems, with a goal of building a technology pipeline from research to commercialization. We use multi-disciplinary approaches and state of the art technologies in systems engineering, machine learning, vision systems, mechatronics, controls, expert systems, dynamic modeling, industrial engineering, and sensor fusion. Undergraduate and graduate students engage in projects with deliverables involving hands-on basic and applied research in autonomy with applications on land (on-road and off-road), in the air and underwater. Please contact us to learn about opportunities for corporate engagement with the lab and newly formed center.
